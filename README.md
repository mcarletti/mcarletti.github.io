# mcarletti.github.io

Hi, this is Marco ðŸ‘‹  
This is my simple blog and personal frontpage.

## Getting started

I'm not a webmaster nor a designer, so I decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build this site.  
I know nothing about Go, but I found Hugo easier than the alternatives.

### Installation

First of all, download this repository and all submodules.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mcarletti/mcarletti.github.io.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To build a local website, you need to install Hugo. Unfortunately, `apt` package manager brings an old version of the library, so I suggest you to install it via `snap`. At the time of writing, the latest version is 0.125.6.

```bash
snap install hugo
```

To build the website and get a local server, you simply need to run the following command from the root folder of the project.

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` is optional but it allows you to see draft content.

### Add new content

You can manually create a file in the right folder, however you would need to create the header accordingly. That's pretty boring.

Hugo provides an utility which refers to `archetypes/default.md` template file. The use of the template is automatic, so you can simply run the following command.

```bash
hugo new content posts/new-awesome-article.md
```

The header will be something like the following, `---` included.

```yaml
---
author: "Marco Carletti"
title: "Hello World"
date: 2024-05-07T12:20:23+02:00
draft: true
tags: []
---
```

Once finished adding your content, don't forget to set `draft` to false and add the proper tags as a list of strings.

### Deployment

You need to create an Action in the action group and... Nevermind.  
Hugo has a fairly simple [documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), but it works.  
If I was able to do it, you can do it too. Read it.

After that, make your changes and push them to the `main` branch.  
Let the buider action do the rest and enjoy your new website in a few seconds ðŸš€

## Notes

I still don't understand why images are not displayed if they are located in the `assets` folder.  
Maybe it's the theme I'm using, but I don't care too much (hey, I simply want my website published).  
I found [this](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/cannot-get-images-to-appear-in-content-and-main-page/14017) workaround: I put the images in the `static` folder and I reference them with the `/` prefix.
