Have you ever wanted to run a local ChatGPT with full control and features?  
Yeah, me too.

First of all, a disclaimer: running a local installation of a GPT-like model is not cheap. It requires a powerful machine, that is, you will probably use this guide only to play with AI technologies. Nevertheless, it's worth trying and definitely you'll end up with a better comprehension of how Generative AI works, at least in practice.

This is the reason for writing this article: it's a set of notes to learn a bit more about the (local) use of Large Language Models (LLM), the integration of a local Image Generator and serving them on the web, so you'll have full control over your own multi-modal ChatGPT.

I'm going to install **Ollama**, **Open-WebUI** and **ComfyUI** in order to manage LLMs, serve a web ui similar to ChatGPT, and generate images, respectively.

## Ollama

<center><img src="https://ollama.com/public/ollama.png" /></center>

It's a manager for an entire library of open LLMs, like Llama-3.1, Phi-3, Mixtral, among many others.
To download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl -y

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Test your brand new local language model manager by downloading a model.

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

Then, run the prompt and start chatting. Yay!
```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

## Open-WebUI

Using the terminal is badass, and it's quite cool and fast.  
However, we are used to fancy and minimal interfaces, and Ollama without an interface is pretty boring.

That's why we are goin to install [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), a more complete clone of ChatGPT interface.  
Before jumping in the installation instruction, create a `conda` environment (it will be used for the next steps). Make sure to use Python 3.11 or above to match the requirements.

```bash
conda create -n ollama python=3.11
conda activate ollama
```

Forget docker. I've found easier and lightweight to use the experimental [installation with `pip`](https://docs.openwebui.com/#installation-with-pip-beta).

```bash
pip install open-webui
```

This is straightforward! Serve the webui and use your downloaded ollama models locally with a cool interface stolen by ChatGPT.  
You can access the server from [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080). It is also visible from your local network.

```bash
open-webui serve
```

## ComfyUI

Why don't you update your local clone of ChatGPT with image creation capabilities?  
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) is what you need. I'm not going to explain how it works, however it's enough to know ComfyUI allows to create a nodes workflow (like in Blender or Unreal Engine, if you are familiar with those tools) to load pre-trained models or checkpoints, like SDXL or Flux.1, control the latent space and many other useful operations.  
Simply pass a text prompt to the text encoder (usually, it is a CLIP-based node), click the play button and wait for your image to be generated.

To install the image generator, we need to install a repository and update our conda environment.

1. Clone the repository from Github.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
```

2. Enter the directory, then create and enter a conda environment with Python 3.11 or above (you should already have it).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server and take note of the `host:port` (it should be: [http://127.0.0.1:8188](http://127.0.0.1:8188)).
```bash
python main.py
```

Add `--listen` to expose the server outside the localhost, binding it to [http://0.0.0.0:8188](http://0.0.0.0:8188).

To download new models, see [this](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/models/#Popular_Stable_Diffusion_Models) link.

### Link ComfyUI in Open-WebUI

ComfyUI is a standalone application, however its usage in Open-WebUI is very simple.  
Just open the `Admin Panel` > `Settings` > `Images`, and play with the settings.

<img src="/assets/admin_settings.png" />

The minimum required steps are the following:

1. Set **Image Generation Engine** to ComfyUI.
1. Set **ComfyUI Base URL** with `http://localhost:8188/` (update this according to your ComfyUI settings).
1. Enable **Dev Mode** in ComfyUI settings.
1. Setup your preferred worflow in ComfyUI and **Export (API)** from the *Workflow* menu as a json file.
1. Return to Open-WebUI settings and import the workflow json file.
1. After importing, map the **ComfyUI Workflow Nodes** according to the imported node IDs.
1. Select the desired checkpoint from **Set Default Model** drop-down list.

Don't forget to save to apply! Now, every time your LLM generates a response, you can click a small icon of an image right below the generated text. It will take a while, and woilÃ ! A brand new generated image is now shown in the chat.

At [this link](https://open-webui.com/comfyui/), you can find more information on how to set up Open-WebUI + ComfyUI.

## Update

Every now and then, it's good practice to update all packages to fix issues and get the newer features.  
To keep your installation up-to-date, follow these steps:

```bash
# update ollama by re-run the installation script
sudo apt update
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# enter the environment
conda activate ollama
# update the "chat-gpt" like interface
pip install open-webui --upgrade
# update image generator code
cd ComfyUI/
git fetch
git pull
```

That's it. Enjoy your brand new local AI assistant ðŸ˜ƒ
